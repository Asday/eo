# Feature

A "feature" is a shared set of code that implements an entire logical feature.  A system is loaded by servers and services and called as required.

For example, a station server might need to call the wallet feature to move money from one wallet to another after a trade, while the market service might need to call the wallet feature to deduct money from a wallet for taxes.
